This is a (right now very small!) library of templates/letters/etc.
that may be helpful for someone transitioning genders.

* email-to-coworkers.docx - Email that can be modified and sent to
  coworkers about your gender transition. This will need to be
  edited as appropriate for your specific situation - for instance,
  it mentions legal name change, which not everyone does before the
  work transition (so just take that phrase out if needed).
  
* Long-Coming-Out-Professional.docx - This can be attached to the email
  to coworkers (above) for coworkers who wanted additional details.  It
  is also useful for the occasionally contact you bump into years after
  transition who might not know about your transition.

* namechange-template.docx - Letter to send to companies, government
  agencies, etc, after changing your legal name.  I print out a bunch of
  these with just a blank line for "account number" and fill that in
  by hand (with a pen) when needed.  I can mail out quite a few name
  and gender changes at once this way.  I'll also include any formal
  forms that the organization might need, a court order and/or a copy
  of my ID for the name change, and, if needed, the appropriate gender
  transition documentation.
