This is a (right now very small!) library of templates/letters/etc.
that may be helpful for someone transitioning genders.

* namechange-template.docx - Letter to send to companies, government
  agencies, etc, after changing your legal name.  I print out a bunch of
  these with just a blank line for "account number" and fill that in
  by hand (with a pen) when needed.  I can mail out quite a few name
  and gender changes at once this way.  I'll also include any formal
  forms that the organization might need, a court order and/or a copy
  of my ID for the name change, and, if needed, the appropriate gender
  transition documentation.
